### Overview
-A supply chain is made up of several businesses and individuals that work together to produce goods and distribute them to customers. At the beginning of a supply chain, a producer buys the raw materials, and at the conclusion, a vehicle delivers the finished good. To save expenses and keep an effective system, businesses need to understand the logistics of their own supply chains. Maintaining a strong supply chain gives you a competitive edge and guarantees on-time delivery of your goods. Finding the supply chain elements that need to be changed before client delivery is the project's goal.
-  For a supply chain, there are three different kinds of analyses that can be done.In order to improve our decision-making, descriptive statistics can assist us in finding patterns in supply chain logistics. We also analyze if there are different routes we can take to decrease the shipping costs and shipping time to improve delivery logistics.

- In order to carry out this supply chain analysis, we will specify our goal, analyze our suppliers in-depth, choose KPIs, and summarize our conclusions.
# Objective: 
- The purpose of this project is to analyze supplier in-depth data for a fashion start-up , summarize KIPS , and find if there is an optimal route to
  decrease the shipping cost and shipping time.
